## 4. Middleware Registration

Updated bootstrap/app.php to register all ownership middleware:

- campaign.owner
- adslot.owner
- creative.owner

## 5. Business Rules Implementation

### 5.1 Campaign Budget Management
- Budget allocation from user balance to campaign
- Budget deduction as campaign runs
- Automatic deactivation when budget is exhausted
- Budget release back to user when campaign ends

### 5.2 Ad Display Logic
- Only active campaigns and creatives are displayed
- Only active ad slots display advertisements
- Only active sites display ad slots

### 5.3 Entity Validation Rules
- Sites must have unique URLs
- Campaigns must have a start date before the end date
- Campaign budgets must be positive values
- Ad slot pricing must be non-negative
- Creatives must have valid content based on their type
