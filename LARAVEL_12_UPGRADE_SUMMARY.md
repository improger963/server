php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear

# Run migrations (none needed)
php artisan migrate

# Test the application (no tests found)
php artisan test
```

## Verification

### Laravel Version
The application is now running Laravel Framework 12.26.4, confirmed by running:
```bash
php artisan --version
```

### Compatibility
All existing functionality should remain intact as Laravel 12 is a gradual upgrade from Laravel 11 with minimal breaking changes.

## Additional Notes

### Frontend Dependencies
The frontend dependencies in `package.json` are already up-to-date:
- Vite 7.0.4
- TailwindCSS 4.0.0
- Other related packages

### No Database Migrations Required
No new database migrations were required for the Laravel 12 upgrade.

### No Configuration Changes Required
No new configuration files needed to be published for Laravel 12 compatibility.

## Next Steps

1. **Test Application Functionality**: Manually test all application features to ensure they work correctly with Laravel 12
2. **Update Documentation**: Update any documentation that references Laravel version-specific features
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check application logs for any warnings or errors after the upgrade
4. **Performance Testing**: Run performance tests to ensure the upgrade hasn't negatively impacted application performance

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after the upgrade, the previous version can be restored by:
1. Reverting the `composer.json` file to the previous version
2. Running `composer update` to downgrade dependencies
3. Clearing all caches again
